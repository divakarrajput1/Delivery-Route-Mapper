# Delivery Route Mapper

This project demonstrates a full data pipeline for geospatial analysis starting from data collection, geocoding, storing in PostGIS, visualizing in QGIS, and ending with an interactive map built with Python Folium. The project is scalable and can be used for further analysis or real-world delivery route optimizations, making it a useful tool for businesses managing logistics and deliveries.
